\begin{abstract}
To assist in network diagnostics the \emph{visualtrace} tool is designed to better visualize the results of the commonly used diagnostic tools \emph{traceroute} and \emph{tracert}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The internet is routed in a highly dynamic fashion. Several tools exist to gather diagnostic information about the chosen route from a certain machine to another, like the Unix tool \emph{traceroute}. The output of this tool is however very straightforward, textual, and requires some time to understand. This is even more the case when one wants to combine results to come to better conclusions. We propose a tool that shows this output in a more straightforward way and also combines multiple results in an intuitive way to provide better insight in networking issues and bottlenecks.

The tool consists of three parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item The parser is responsible for parsing output from a trace command into a graph structure;
\item The graph preprocessor merges multiple graphs into one;
\item The graph renderer visualizes the final graph.
\end{itemize}

\section{Parser}
The parser is very simple but currently not very flexible nor elegant. We only support Unix style output at the moment. It constructs a graph of the structure depicted in the following figure.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript]
graph = {
  graphs: integer,      // amount of sub graphs
  nodes: [node, ...],   // list of graph nodes
  links: [link, ...]    // list of links between nodes
};
node = {
  group: integer,       // sub graph identifier, used to color
  depth: integer,       // depicting what 'hop' this node is
  hostname: string,
  ip: string,
  name: hostname + ip,
  latencies: [float, ...] // latency per ping request in ms
};
link = {
  source: integer,      // index of the source node
  target: integer       // index of the target node
};
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Graph preprocessor}
The graph preprocessor merges multiple graphs into one super-graph, so that we can combine results of multiple traces in one visualization. To do this, we first simply add them together, and after that merge all duplicate nodes. 

Currently, since we consider every pair in the graph for duplicity, this is done in an $O(n^2)$ time complexity (with $n$ being the size of the newly constructed supergraph) fashion which is acceptable.

However this problem could also be tackled in an $O(n \log n)$ solution by constructing a sorted list of all nodes and only checking only up-following pairs.
